"
The short version of the advice on the Prelude is:

    Use fmap instead of map.
    Use Foldable and Traversable instead of the Control.Monad, and Data.List versions of traversals.
    Avoid partial functions like head and read or use their total variants.
    Avoid asynchronous exceptions.
    Avoid boolean blind functions."
